DESCRIPTION
-----------

Use LDA to prioritize test cases.

tcp.lda can be used to prioritize a given set of test cases, without having to
execute those test cases. tcp.lda works statically on the content of the test
cases itself, without needing access to the actual source code of the SUT.

For theoretical details and case studies, see our paper:

Please see the R package documentation for further information.
